[edward025:15087] plm:tm: failed to poll for a spawned daemon, return status = 17002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A daemon (pid unknown) died unexpectedly on signal 1  while attempting to
launch so we are aborting.

There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec noticed that the job aborted, but has no info as to the process
that caused that situation.

mpiexec was unable to cleanly terminate the daemons on the nodes shown
below. Additional manual cleanup may be required - please refer to
the "orte-clean" tool for assistance.
